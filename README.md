## Hi, I'm Rohit! ‚úåÔ∏è


- ‚è≠Ô∏è What's next for me: 
  * I'm an incoming Engineering Product Manager at C.H. Robinson, a 3PL/Supply Chain company located right outside of Minneapolis, MN. I'll be starting with the June 2021  rotation of [HatCHRy](https://engineering.chrobinson.com/culture/hatchry-ch-robinson-it-onboarding/), their 3-month technical onboarding program.
  
    * It was a difficult decision to leave the realm of software engineering in the proprietary trading space, but I'm super excited to make the transition to the product side of software engineering! I've gotta start prepping for Minnesota, though ü•∂

- üñ•Ô∏è What I'm working on:
  * My revamped personal website, including my blog posts, portfolio, and other small Tailwind CSS components.
  * OpenSES (Securities Exchange Simulator), a project I started to create a unified place for our trading strategies to be executed, backtested, and diagnosed. 
    * Check out the concept proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SMm2y2RSxEx6QeRjgA34Z7S4gdYm4nK4sOFEdrkiJaQ/edit?usp=sharing), the tech spec sheet is coming soon!
  * Creating a method for @pittcsc and Pitt alumni to better be in touch with current students for interview prep + mentorship
  * Other random side projects just for ‚ú® _fun_ ‚ú® and ‚ú® _learning_ ‚ú®

- üì´ Books I'm reading (I'll get rid of the read ones once my website shelf is finished!):
  * ~~*Hit Refresh* by Satya Nadella (CEO, Microsoft)~~
  * ~~*The Network Imperative* by  Barry Libert, Megan Beck, and Yoram Wind~~
